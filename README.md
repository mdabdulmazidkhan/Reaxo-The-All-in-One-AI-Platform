# Reaxo — The All-in-One AI Platform 🤖

Reaxo is an all-in-one, scalable web platform that brings multiple AI capabilities together in a single app. The platform powers its AI models using Zeabur AI Hub, so models run in a hosted, scalable environment while the web app delivers an integrated user experience.
